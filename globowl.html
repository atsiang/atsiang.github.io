<h4>The Challenge</h4>
<h3>How Can an App Help Third-Culture Kids Feel More Connected to Their Roots?</h3>

<p>Immigrants and their descendants are heavily encouraged to adapt to American/Canadian culture and <span class="bolded">assimilate and become disconnected from their original cultures</span> as a result. As they approach adulthood, they become more aware of this and they
seek to better understand their own cultural identities, but don’t know where or how to learn more about the countries and
cultures their families came from. </p>
</div>


<h4> My Solution </h4>
<h3> Experiencing Culture Through Cuisine </h3>

<p><a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/o1GZCdRV2KGd9kLDdJoYkI/globowl-final?node-id=559%3A268&scaling=scale-down" target="_blank">Globowl</a> is an educational app that uses <span class="bolded">short video lessons</span> to teach its users about different cultures through the <span class="bolded">lens of food and cuisine</span>. The videos explain topics such as food-related vocabulary, customs, traditions and holidays, and more. Users are <span class="bolded">rewarded for completing lessons</span> and quizzes by <span class="bolded">unlocking recipes</span> they can try out themselves. </p>

<h4>Process</h4>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>In order to gain a better understanding of the user base, I <span class="bolded">conducted a survey for university students</span> that asked them about
how and where they grew up (North America or elsewhere). Participants were asked about <span class="bolded">what aspects of their culture they
already had knowledge about</span> and which ones they were most interested in as well as what was keeping them from learning
more. I found that <span class="bolded">Food and Language were what participants were most interested in</span> and the <span class="bolded">main obstacles listed were</span>: a
<span class="bolded">lack of motivation/laziness</span>, coming from <span class="bolded">mixed backgrounds</span> where only one side was favoured, <span class="bolded">feeling ashamed/bullied</span> for
their culture, and simply <span class="bolded">not knowing where to go to learn more.</class></p>
<img src="img/globowl-survey.png" alt="" class="project-page-img">	
	
<p>Next, I <span class="bolded">looked into apps and services already existed in this space</span> and how they tackled the problem: I found that they were <span class="bolded">very experiential and more story-based</span>. I also did some research on <span class="bolded">how adults learn best</span> and found that
they require lessons that are <span class="bolded">practical and relevant</span> to their daily lives that they identify more with <span class="bolded">emotionally driven content</span>,
and that they enjoy being able to have some <span class="bolded">freedom to explore topics on their own</span>.</p>
<p>With the information I gathered from my research and my user survey, I was able to develop two user personas that reflected
everything I had learned. My mentor put a <span class="bolded">strong emphasis on research and making target-centric decisions</span>, so these personas
were what I referred to throughout the design and ideation process.</p>

<h3>Mockups</h3>
<p>The sections that <span class="bolded">went through the most changes were Cook, Learn and Pantry</span>. I had started out using tabs to separate
sub-pages, but felt that they were a bit difficult to use for larger fingers. I thought the Lessons and Quizzes sections should be
similar but still distinct so users wouldn’t confuse them. I also wanted to reduce the number of interactions it would take to get
to view recipes, so the Cook homepage already has recipes ready to browse on top of categories to tap into. For the Pantry, a
lot of the changes focused on emphasizing the illustrations of the ingredients and allowing users to better see the details of the
illustrations.</p>

<h3> User Flows </h3>

<img src="img/ciyu-userflow-03.jpg" alt="" class="postcard-page-img"> -->

<h3> Visuals </h3>
<p>The app uses a mostly warm color palette that reflects a <span class="bolded">friendly and inviting feel</span>. The shapes used in the backgrounds and illustrations were created to <span class="bolded">evoke different tastes, sounds and smells</span> one might experience in the kitchen. Key concepts and words are visually highlighted to aid users in retaining what they’ve learned. The illustrations are <span class="bolded">playful</span>, but still <span class="bolded">realistic</span> enough to be recognizable.</p>

<h3>Final Outcome & Takeaways</h3>

<p class="m-bottom-4">Throughout this process, I’ve learned how important it is to keep in mind the user personas when designing in order to make
target-centric decisions. The <span class="bolded">research that I did before my ideation phase was really key</span> to figuring out which features were
most important and how they should be implemented. For example, I made sure to include the option to switch between
lessons from different cultures since a lot of the people in my target audience came from mixed backgrounds.
<br>
<br>
 Something that I‘d like to <span class="bolded">develop further is the events page</span>: how
RSVPing works, viewing the numbers of attendees at events, as well as how bonus recipes are redeemed after events/how to
verify that someone has attended an event. I would also like to work more on the <span class="bolded">idea of a journal/photo album</span> where users can
store <span class="bolded">photos of the recipes they have attempted</span>, and possibly share them and view others’ attempts.
